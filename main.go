// rcp connects regular Redis-using applications to a Redis (3.0+) Cluster
package main // import "luit.eu/rcp"

import "luit.eu/rcp/cmd"

func main() {
	cmd.Execute()
}

// Step 1: Dumb mode
//  Just connect to the cluster through the known host and try to use it.
//  Every time a reply comes back as -MOVED or -ASK, disconnect from the
//  current node, and connect to whatever the -MOVED or -ASK pointed to.
//
// Step 2: Slightly smarter
//  Inspect commands to see which node to route to, keeping a slot state of
//  the cluster to ask the right node most of the queries. Still without
//  pooling.
//
// Step 3:
//  Pooling (configurable), pipelining (configurable), marking commands as
//  safe for multiplexing backend connections.
